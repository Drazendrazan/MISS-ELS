# Adding VCF files

In order to 'install' a new VCF for a vehicle, you have to perform some steps. Don't worry, you'll get it once you've done it a couple of times!

1. Make sure the vehicle has some extras to work with
2. Create a new VCF, either by using [the Configurator](https://matsn0w.github.io/MISS-ELS) or by writing it yourself
3. Save the file in `.../your resource/xmlFiles/`, make sure it is an `.xml` file
4. Add the file to your `config.lua` file, under the section `Config.ELSFiles` >> make sure to use **exactly** the same file name!
5. Restart the MISS ELS resource if it was currently running

That's it!
